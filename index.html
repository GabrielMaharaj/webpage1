Gabriel.M Hi I'm Gabriel, I'm studying computer Science . Before studying computer science at university, I had completed 15 hours of a code academy java course. As your progress through your degree at City you will be able to add more here (e.g., interests, skills, experience, a link to a CV). However, even then, it's better to keep this information concise (about a paragraph or two) and let your CV and the projects below to do the rest of the talking.
