Add some information about yourself. 
For now we're happy to know anything you're willing to share about yourself (though one thing we are curious about is your programming experience before bootcamp).
As your progress through your degree at City you will be able to add more here (e.g., interests, skills, experience, a link to a CV). 
However, even then, it's better to keep this information concise (about a paragraph or two) and let your CV and the projects below to do the rest of the talking.


Bootcamp 2020: Forest scene
My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at City (2020). 
This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the use of arrays, loops, and randomness.
 I created a forest scene in which details of each tree (e.g. position, trunk color and size, crown color and shape) are stored in parallel 2D arrays. 
Trees are arranged in a regular grid but their positions are jittered by small random offsets to create the impression of a real forest.
 Similarly, each tree trunk and crown has a individual color shade, obtained using random variations of brown and green. 
Finally, the forest changes over time: trees grow and their crowns become more pale to suggest seasonal change ( from spring to autumn).
